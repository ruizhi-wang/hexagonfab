# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

    subtitle: "Designing 2D Materials"
    landing-mission: "It is our mission to design novel nanomaterials for innovative future applications in biotechnology, sensing and quantum computing. Our technology is scalable and sustainable. At HexagonFab, we bring these materials from the laboratory to the market."
    landing-doing:
      "HexagonFab develops materials for your application. We offer individual 2D materials like graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). But going a step further, we are the world's first company to offer vertical stacks of 2D materials, commonly known as van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, on an industrial scale. Our advanced process technology allows the assembly of 2D materials with atomic precision layer by layer. We can engineer material properties at unprecedented level for your specific requirements. Please see our product page for availability."
    landing-why:
      "By scaling to the nanoscale, we not only reduce material input, but also enable novel technologies. New material properties open the door to new application that have so far been unmet with conventional material approaches. Our material will enable affordable, ultrasensitive point of care bio-sensors, advanced photo-detectors and controlled single photon emitters for quantum computing."
